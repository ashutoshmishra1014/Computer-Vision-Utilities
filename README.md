# Computer-Vision-Utilities
This repository is intended to be a store house of all the relevant and frequently usable scripts for processing of images
Currently it includes 2 files:
1) binarize_image_sauvola_thresholding.py
Applies "Sauvola" thresholding to prepare a binary image out of the given input image.

2) smoothen_image.py
Smoothens image using "fastNlMeansDenoising" and "Gaussian blur".
